<b><i>We Never Broke Up</i></b>

We never broke up. I am on my second cup of coffee
and you're just waking
up. The sun is streaming through
the curtains and I go to kiss your back.
We never broke up. You find me on the bathroom floor
again after a bad day. You pick me up and we talk it
through. You tell me nothing is ever as bad as it seems.
Not when we have each other.
We never broke up. It is two in the morning and we're
laughing so much, it hurts. We keep telling each other to
go to sleep, but neither one of us does. I was so happy
I could have died that night. Sometimes I wish I had.
We never broke up. Only, we did. As I lie awake wishing,
willing you here. Dreaming of the day you're in my arms
again, asking me why did we ever break up.
