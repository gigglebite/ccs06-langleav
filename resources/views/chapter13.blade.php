<b><i>Broken</i></b>

They put me in a gown and sat me in a chair and a man in a
white coat showed me picture card after card and said tell me
the first thing that comes to your mind.
First he showed me a china plate and I said, hunger.
Then he showed me a dead bird and I said, fallen.
Then he showed a picture of you.
I closed my eyes and said, broken.
