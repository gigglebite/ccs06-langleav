<b><i>The Fisherman</i></b>

Ispend a lot of time thinking, maybe a little too much, about
things that have been. Like when we first met and I told
you someday, I would marry a fisherman and live by the sea.
Then as we began to fall in love, that throwaway comment
grew in significance.

Whereas you, on the other hand, are always thinking, what
if? Spinning these wild hypotheticals that are sometimes sad,
other times hilarious. Often, I wonder if we are living in
one of them. But then, I don't think it's possible
-even for you- to conjure something up this perfect.

And that is our main point of difference. I will keep mining
ground we've covered to see if there is anything worth
salvaging, and you will always be looking for new territory
to explore. But there will be times when we switch, when
you will be behind that metal detector, and I
will be standing at the helm.

So we'll always be okay. I'm certain of it because this,
right here with you, is everything I have ever wanted.

..........

You're my fisherman.

I love it.

The honesty and insight make this story so precious.

I will keep mining ground we've covered to see if there is
anything worth salvaging, and you will always be looking

switch, where you will be behind that metal detector, and I will
be standing at the helm.

I am your fisherman. Come live with me by the sea.
