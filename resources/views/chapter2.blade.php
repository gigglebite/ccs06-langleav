<b><i>New Beginnings</i></b>

If I have learned anything this year, it's that I won't ever be
ready for what life throws at me. I will never be adequately
prepared. I won't have the right words when it counts for
something. I won't know the right answer when fate itself is
staring me down.

I've learned I can go on waiting for something, sustained
by hope and nothing more, or I can put it to one side and
shrug my shoulders. Bravely accept the fact that I can't keep
my heart safe any more than I can stop love from taking
everything from me.

I have learned to stop saying yes when I don't mean it-
to live as authentically as I know how. To allow the tips of
my fingers to skirt the darkness, as long as I remember to
Keep my eyes fixed on the light. And as one door opens and
another closes, I will move forward with the knowledge that
unlike so many others, I have another year ahead of me
another shot at making it all the way around the sun, and a
chance to get it right this time 'round.
