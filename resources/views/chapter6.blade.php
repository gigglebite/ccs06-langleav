<b><i>Keys to the Kingdom</i></b>

If a boy asks you for your name, don't give it to him. He
will say it back to you in a voice like gravel and honey, and
you will crave his hands all rough and sweet. But you're not
the kind of girl who builds her house from sticks; you are a
fortress, stubborn and strong. Do not give away the keys to
the kingdom to anyone less than a king.
