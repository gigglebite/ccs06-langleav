<b><i>Moving On</i></b>

Leave him, let him go. Don't be the crazy ex-girlfriend or
the shoulder to cry on. You're more than just an ego boost,
a story he can tell someone he's trying to impress. Just walk
away with your head held high and don't give him another
second of your time. I know you love him so much that
every step is killing you. But this is the moment you'll always
look back on as the day you put yourself first. Go and make
something beautiful of your life and I promise you, one day
you'll forget he was ever there.
